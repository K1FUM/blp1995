# BLP(1995) Replication by Julia

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Haozhan Gao ([link](https://www.haozhangao.net/home)) and Mark Ponder ([link](https://mark-ponder.com/)) for generously sharing their code, which served as a valuable reference for this work.

This file contains the replication of Table III and Table IV from the seminal paper by BLP (1995).

While the calculations in this file produce the desired results, it's worth noting that there is room for improvement in terms of computational efficiency. Additionally, the file currently lacks the computation of standard errors and the replication of price elasticity. By increasing the maximum iteration count and simulation draws, the precision of the results could be potentially enhanced.

I plan to make further updates to this file when time permits.

Feel free to let me know if you have any advice!
